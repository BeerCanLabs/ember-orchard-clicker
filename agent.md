# Repository rules for agents

1. Treat `kpf.md` as the source of truth for key product functionality.
2. For every changed or new KPF, update `kpf.md` and add or update an automated test in `test/` in the same change.
3. Before every commit, run `npm test`. Do not commit if any KPF test fails.
4. Before handing off a user-facing change, verify the relevant KPF in the running app when doing so does not alter a user's saved progress.
5. Keep product rules simple, user-visible, and independently testable.
